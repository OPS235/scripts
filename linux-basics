INTRODUCTION TO SENECA'S COMPUTER SERVERS

Welcome to Seneca's Computer lab!

This tutorial will provide you with "hands-on" practice
when working with the MATRIX computer system.

WHAT IS MATRIX?


Matrix is a Linux cluster (collection of servers).
It runs SuSe Linux  which is a distribution or 'flavour'
of Unix. The full domain name of matrix is matrix.senecac.on.ca.

The main purpose of Matrix is to hold student files so
they can be accessed from the labs (by logging into a Linux
workstation) or from home (by using the telnet application).
Matrix is used to teach Unix. Students can also use graphical
Linux while within the Seneca College computer labs to learn
about the Graphical User Interface (GUI). This provides an
alternative to using Microsoft Windows Operating System.

BIF students will be using the Matrix server to practice 
Linux operating system commands, and performing assigments
for the BIF713 course...

UNIX / LINUX OPERATING SYSTEMS

All computer systems require an operating system
to control the computer hardware, to schedule
important routine tasks, and to allow the user
to interact with the computer system.

The UNIX & LINUX operating systems are well suited for
students due to their many features:

     Accomodates multiple users
     Provides for user communication
     Allows for sharing of files
     Provides easy access to the Internet

In fact, the UNIX and LINUX operating systems are
quite similar to each other!

Press <ENTER> to continue
+

					clear
					cat <<+
SHELLS

One method to communicate with the UNIX
and LINUX operating systems is to enter
commands (or program names) at a prompt or
"shell".

The shell is an interface between the UNIX/LINUX
operating system and the user. When the
shell is in operation, it provides a prompt
and waits for the user to type in a command
and press the ENTER key.

Press <ENTER> to continue

+
					read null
					clear
					cat <<+
The shell will not run or "execute" a command
that the user types until the ENTER key is pressed.

This allows the user to edit or make
corrections to their commands in case they
make a mistake before they press ENTER.

Press <ENTER> to continue
+
					read null
					clear
					cat <<+
You can backspace at the shell prompt
by pressing one of these keys:

     <BACKSPACE>
or   <CTRL><BACKSPACE>
or   <CTRL><h>

Type the following text: "I made a mistike"


If you notice strange characters such as "]"
or "^H", simply try another key combination above!

When you want to continue with this tutorial,
press <ENTER>

+
	            printf "\tType \"I made a mistike\" Here   >> "
		    read null
		    cat <<+

It is recommended to memorize all key combinations

<BACKSPACE>
<CTRL><BACKSPACE>
<CTRL><h>

because different systems may vary on which
of those key combination will work.

Press <ENTER> to continue
+
	            read null
		    clear
		    cat <<+
Here are some other useful shell editing keys:

<CTRL><w> - Deletes a word

Type the following text: "This is not bad!"
and THEN press <CTRL><W> to see what happens. When
you want to continue with this tutorial, press <ENTER>

+
	            printf "\tType \"This is not bad!\" Here   >> "
		    read null
		    cat <<+

<CTRL><u> - Deletes entire line

Type the following text: "Oops! I messed up!"
and THEN press <CTRL><U> to see what happens. When you want
to continue with this tutorial, press <ENTER>

+
	            printf "\tType \"Oops! I messed up!\" Here   >> "
		    read null
$HOME/$$ 19 2> /dev/null
$HOME/$$ 17 2> /dev/null
		clear
		cat <<+
Good, the computer terminal's display has
become "unlocked".

Press <ENTER> to continue
+
		read null
		clear
		cat <<+
WARNING

Your terminal will actually store whatever you type in
the keyboard, which may be "played back" after you press
<CTRL><q>.

If you are working in MATRIX and you notice that your
terminal has stopped working, press <CTRL><q> before
typing anything else!

SIMPLE LINUX COMMANDS

Since this may be your first time using
Unix or Linux, we will introduce you to
a few simple operating system commands.

The Unix and Linux operating systems are
case-sensitive. This means that the operating
systems treat (interpret) lowercase and uppercase
differently from each other. Most Unix and Linux
operating system commands are in lowercase.

Press <ENTER> to continue
+
		read null
		clear
		cat <<+
Let's demonstrate what happens if we enter a
Unix or Linux command that is in uppercase.

Issue the following command:

        PWD

+
				printf "\tENTER COMMAND HERE >> "
                		read com1_1
                		until [ "$com1_1" = "PWD" ]
                		do
                		    printf "\thint: PWD\n"
                		    printf "\tPLEASE TRY AGAIN   >> "
                		    read com1_1
                		done
				printf "$com1_1\n" >> $HOME/output.$$
                		$com1_1 2> temp.$$
				printf "bash"
				cat temp.$$ | cut -c35- 
				cat <<+

You should notice an error message
that appears above. This particular
error message indicates that the shell
(called "bash") cannot find the command
called "PWD".

Press <ENTER> to continue
+
				read null
				clear
				cat <<+
Try issuing the same command, but in lowercase

eg.	pwd

+
				printf "\tENTER COMMAND HERE >> "
                		read com1_1
                		until [ "$com1_1" = "pwd" ]
                		do
                		    printf "\thint: pwd\n"
                		    printf "\tPLEASE TRY AGAIN   >> "
                		    read com1_1
                		done
				printf "$com1_1\n" >> $HOME/output.$$
                		$com1_1
				cat <<+

The text above indicates that you
are in your home directory. This home
directory, which is called "$(echo $HOME | cut -d "/" -f3)"
is considered to be your personal storage
space that allows you to store your own work.

The text "home" indicates the directory
that stores all students' home directories
including yours - $(echo $HOME | cut -d "/" -f3). 

Press <ENTER> to continue
+
				read null
				clear
				cat <<+
CHANGE DIRECTORY LOCATIONS

You do not have to remain in your home
directory all the time. You should be
able to move to any directory that is
contained within your home directory, or
move to other users' directories
(provided they have given you access).

Press <ENTER> to continue
+
				read null
				cat <<+

Before changing directories, let's see what
contents are contained in your home directory by 
issuing the command displayed below:

	ls

+
				printf "\tENTER COMMAND HERE >> "
                		read com1_1
                		until [ "$com1_1" = "ls" ]
                		do
                		    printf "\thint: ls\n"
                		    printf "\tPLEASE TRY AGAIN   >> "
                		    read com1_1
                		done
				printf "$com1_1\n" >> $HOME/output.$$
                		$com1_1
				cat <<+

You should notice a listing of filenames
displayed above. The ls command provides
a compact listing of just the names of the files.

Press <ENTER> to continue
+
				read null
				clear
				cat <<+
In order to provide more information
regarding each file contained in your
home directory, issue the following command
displayed below:

	ls -l

+
				printf "\tENTER COMMAND HERE >> "
                		read com1_1
                		until [ "$com1_1" = "ls -l" ]
                		do
                		    printf "\thint: ls -l\n"
                		    printf "\tPLEASE TRY AGAIN   >> "
                		    read com1_1
                		done
				printf "$com1_1\n" >> $HOME/output.$$
                		$com1_1
				cat <<+

We will discuss next week more about the
contents of this command, but you can see
more information provided for each file.

Press <ENTER> to continue

				cat <<+
CHANGING DIRECTORIES

You may want to change to other user's
directories (if you are permitted by
the user) to view and later copy files.

For example, let's change to the
"bin" directory by issuing the following command:

	cd /bin

+
				printf "\tENTER COMMAND HERE >> "
                		read com1_1
                		until [ "$com1_1" = "cd /bin" ]
                		do
                		    printf "\thint: cd /bin\n"
                		    printf "\tPLEASE TRY AGAIN   >> "
                		    read com1_1
                		done
				printf "$com1_1\n" >> $HOME/output.$$
                		$com1_1

PASSWORDS

It is important to protect your MATRIX
and ZENIT accounts from unauthorized
access.

CONSEQUENCES OF UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS

- Loss of Data
- Copy of Your Work
- Suspension of Account to Illegal Activity

PASSWORD TIPS

Avoid passwords that are words (contained in
any language dictionary spelled forwards or
backwards).

Avoid passwords that consist only of a series
of numbers.

Press <ENTER> to continue
+
				read null
				clear
				cat <<+
PASSWORD TIPS

Creating Good Passwords:

- Think of an easy-to-remember phrase consisting
  of several words, and take the first letter
  from each Word.

e.g. Autumn Leaves Turn Red Yellow Orange

	password: altryo

- Capitalize the first and middle letter and
  add some numbers and should include some
  special character like -, _, .

	better password AlT.ry0

- If you forget your password, try to construct
  it from the phrase and your modification rules.

Press <ENTER> to continue
+
				read null
				clear
				cat <<+
PASSWORD CHANGE

On typical Unix or Linux systems, a user changes
their password by entering the command:

passwd

When changing your password, you will be
asked for the original password for verification.
If you entered the original password correctly,
You will be asked to enter the new password in
twice.

The new password may not be accepted if it does
NOT contain a minimum number of characters, does
not contain special characters, or is too similar
to the original password.

				cat <<+
CHANGING MATRIX PASSWORD

At Seneca College, the procedure to change
your Matrix password is different from
the above-mentioned procedure.

Since Your Matrix userid and Learn e-mail
userid are the same, your Matrix password
is automatically changed when you change
your Learn e-mail password. Therefore, you
should change your Learn e-mail password
(thus your Matrix password) from your
Learn e-mail application.
